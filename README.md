A Python script that iterates through a hardcoded tuple of words and identifies the vowels in each one.

# üÖ∞Ô∏è Vowel Checker

A non-interactive Python script that analyzes a predefined list of words and displays the vowels contained within each.

## Features

* **Vowel Identification**: Scans each word in a hardcoded list to find and display all vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
* **Predefined Word List**: Operates on a static tuple of words defined within the script.
* **Formatted Output**: Clearly displays each word (in uppercase) followed by its vowels on a new line for easy readability.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `vowel_checker.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python vowel_checker.py
    ```
4.  The script will automatically run and print the analysis for every word in its list.

### Example Output

```
Vowel Checker

 In the word LEARN we have a e 
 In the word PROGRAM we have o a 
 In the word LANGUAGE we have a u a e 
 In the word PYTHON we have o 
 ...
```
